# Flappy-Bird-Clone
Developing a Flappy Bird clone in Unity demonstrates essential game development skills such as navigating the Unity Editor, creating and manipulating Game Objects and using Components. Writing scripts for game logic, player movement, and collision detection in C#. Working with sprites, creating simple animations, and using Unity's 2D physics engine for gravity and collisions.

Implementing responsive player controls, procedural obstacle generation, and a scoring system with UI elements. Debugging and optimization techniques, version control with Git, and maintaining a well-organized project structure. Build and deploy the game to different platforms and understand the importance of playtesting and iteration. By the end, I had a solid foundation in game development with Unity.
