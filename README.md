# Flappy-Bird-Clone
When developing a Flappy Bird clone in Unity, I've become familiar with the Unity Editor, creating and manipulating Game Objects and using Components. Scripts for game logic, player movement, and collision detection are written in C#. I worked with sprites, created simple animations, and used Unity's 2D physics engine for gravity and collisions.

Implemented responsive player controls, procedural obstacle generation, and a scoring system. Created and managed UI elements. Debugging and optimization techniques, version control with Git, and maintaining a well-organized project structure. Built and deployed the game to different platforms and understood the importance of playtesting and iteration. By the end, I had a solid foundation in game development with Unity.
