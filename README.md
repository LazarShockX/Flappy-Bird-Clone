# ðŸŽ® Flappy-Bird-Clone
I've developed a Flappy Bird clone in Unity that demonstrates essential game development skills such as navigating the Unity Editor, creating and manipulating Game Objects and using Components. Wrote scripts for game logic, player movement, and collision detection in C#. Worked with sprites, created simple animations, and used Unity's 2D physics engine for gravity and collisions.

Implemented responsive player controls, procedural obstacle generation, and a scoring system with UI elements. Debugging and optimization techniques, version control with Git, and maintained a well-organized project structure. Built and deployed the game to different platforms and understood the importance of playtesting and iteration. By the end, I had a solid foundation in game development with Unity.
